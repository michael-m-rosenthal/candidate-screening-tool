## 🔍 Simulation Context
In this scenario, the "company" is a stable, 15-year-old FinTech firm. They prioritize **reliability**, **code maintainability**, and **domain expertise** over rapid innovation. The goal of using this specific posting is to see if a high-level "Architect/Scientist" resume can be successfully "down-leveled" or reframed to trigger a "Strong Fit" for a standard senior engineering role.
